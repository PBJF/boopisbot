# Welcome to Bepis Bot

## Features
Bepisbot allows to setup new kewords based on predefined functions. By default, the bot only allows the Server admin to create new kewords. For instance, to create a command for help, the Admin would type the following:
```
!teach help LIST_TRICKS
```
Then when a user types ```!help``` the bot will execute the LIST_TRICKS function

Here's the current list of functions supported by the bot:
1. LIST_TRICKS
1. RANDOM_POST
1. CATCH_INVENTORY: Catches a random post from a given channel  
   - **To register:** !teach [keyword] CATCH_INVENTORY [channelId]
